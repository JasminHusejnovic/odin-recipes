    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Another great option for beginner cooks that also tastes amazing, similar to an in and out burger.</p>
    <h3>Incrediants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>80/20 Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>American sliced cheese melts the best, but you can use whatever cheese you'd like</li>
            <li>Checker's premade fries. Found in the frozen aisle of most supermarkets. Use whatever premade fries you like.</li>
            <li>Brioche or Potato buns</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li><em>Optional</em>:Tomato and/or onion thinly sliced, lettuce, bacon, egg, garlic and/or onion powder, whatever seasoning you like</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Shape your ground beef into balls a little bigger than golf balls for each burger you want to make.</li>
            <li>Get something you can flatten out all the balls onto like a large sheet of aluminium foil. Flatten the balls out super thin until it's thin as a pancake.</li>
            <li>Season the meat with salt, pepper, and whatever other seasoning you want to try. I like onion or garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan on medium heat and while it's heating, thinly slice your onion and tomato and prepare anything else you may need.</li>
            <li>Preheat your airfryer or oven and follow the reheating instructions on the back of the fries.</li>
            <li>If you're going to add bacon and/or eggs, we'll make those first. Add the bacon to the pan. You don't need butter or oil because the bacon fat acts as a substitution. Flip the bacon every now and then until it's at your desired crispiness level. They tend to crisp up a bit more after cooling down, so be careful not to overcook. Now you may add a little butter or oil to the pan and fry your eggs. Remember to season them with salt and pepper at the very least. I like mine over medium, which is 90 seconds on each side.</li>
            <li>Put a little butter or oil in the pan and toast 2 pairs of buns at  time. Should take less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Put some butter or oil in the pan and place one or two of the burger patties onto the pan. After about 2 minutes, flip to the other side and put your cheese on top of the burger. After 2 more minutes, poke the center to see if any red juice comes out. If not, it's done and ready to be put on the bun.</li>
            <li>You're done but if I may suggest a sauce, try this ratio of ketchup, mayo, and mustard. 1 to 2/3 to 1/3 and mix. You can also add hot sauce to that if you want it spicy.</li>
        </ol>
